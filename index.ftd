This FTD font `<repo_name>` can be used for your ftd web projects. 

You can use this <repo_name> inside the `FTD` project. Follow below instructions
to use this font package.

-- ds.h3: How to use <repo_name>?

-- ds.code: Add this to your FASTN.ftd
lang: ftd

\-- fastn.dependency: <user_name>.github.io/<repo_name>

-- ds.markdown: 

To use this <repo_name> inside your `ftd` web project, if you are
using our [doc-site](https://github.com/fifthtry/doc-site) theme then you just
have to pass types to `ds.page`

Let's say you are using `doc-site` inside your project then, it's as simple as
making a sandwich.

-- ds.h3: How to use <repo_name> with `ds.page`?

Just import <repo_name> inside your ftd file as shown below:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- import: <user_name>.github.io/<repo_name>


-- ds.markdown: 

and pass <repo_name> types to `ds.page` as shown below:

-- ds.code:
lang: ftd

\-- ds.page:
types: $<repo_name>.types

-- ds.markdown: 

Once you add `types: <repo_name>.types` inside your ftd file, <repo_name> will
be added as fastn default typography to your `ds.page` and to all components you
add inside `ds.page`.
